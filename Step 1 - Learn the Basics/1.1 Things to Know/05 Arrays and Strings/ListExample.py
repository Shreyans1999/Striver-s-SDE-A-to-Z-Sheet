# Arrays in Python:

# Python does not have a built-in array type but uses lists or the array module for array-like structures.
# Lists are more commonly used because they are versatile and can hold mixed data types.

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)


# List Example with For Loop

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

print("List elements doubled:")
for item in my_list:
    print(item * 2)
